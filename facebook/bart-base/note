The user needs to download the model weights from https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-base/tree/main and put them in this directory.

Before beginning training, you should have the following files:

config.json  

merges.txt  

pytorch_model.bin  

tokenizer.json  

vocab.json

Caution: Without this directory and the files, the pretrained model weights and tokenizer cannot be loaded
